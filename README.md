# Summary
This is my own minimal implementation of a hash table. Goal is to think through insertion with linear probing and retrieval by key.

HashTable class performance (defined in `hash_table.py`) is examined in
`eval_hash_test.py` using the `pytest` module.

Run `pytest` on UNIX shell. This checks the directory for `*test.py` module for tests.
